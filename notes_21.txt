Beyond Physical Memory: Mechanisms

21.1 Swap Space
    A space on the disk for moving pages back and forth
        Out of memory/Into memory
    OS will need to remember the disk address of a given page

21.2 The Present Bit
    When the hardware looks in the PTE, it may find that the page is not present in physical memory
        Set to 1: Page is present at physical memory 
        Set to 0: Page is not in memory but on disk
            Usually referred as "page fault"

21.3 The Page Fault
    Page-fault handler determines what to do when it encounters a page fault
        If page is not present and has been swapped to disk, OS will need to swap the page into memory to service the page fault
            Looks in the PTE to find address
            Issues request to disk to fetch page into memory
            OS update the page table to mark page as present
            Update PFN field of PTE
            Retry instruction
                Generate TLB miss
                Serviced & update TLB with translation

21.4 What If Memory Is Full?
    Page-replacement policy
        Replace pages/page out to make room for the new page(s) the OS is about to bring in to the swap space

21.5 Page Fault Control Flow
    When TLB miss occurs
        Page was both present and valid
            TLB miss handler can grab PFN from the PTE & retry (TLB hit)
        Page fault handler must be run
            Page was valid, but not present in physical memory
        Page is invalid
            Hardware traps this access, OS trap handler runs, process is terminated

    Page Fault
        OS must find physical frame for the soon-to-be-faulted-in page to reside within
            If no such page, ahve to wait for replacement algorithm
        With physical frame, handler issues I/O request to read in the page from swap space
        OS updates page table and retries instruction
        Will result in TLB miss, then TLB hit

21.6 When Replacements Really Occur
    High Watermark (HW)
    Low Watermark (LW)
    When OS notices there are fewer than LW pages available, background thread for freeing memory runs
        Swap daemon or Page daemon
    Thread evicts pages until there are HW pages available
