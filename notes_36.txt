I/O Devices

36.1 System Architecture
    Main memory is attached to the CPU via memory bus
    Devices are connected to the system via a general I/O bus
        Graphics and higher performance I/O devices
    Devices are connected via peripheral bus
        SCSI, SATA, USB
            Slowest devices including disks, mice

36.2 A Canonical Device
    Two important components
        Hardware Interface
            Allows the system software to control its operation
        Internal Structure
            Implementing the abstraction the device presents to the system
            Firmware
                Software within hardware device to implement its functionality

36.3 The Canonical Protocol
    Status Register
        To see the current status of the device
    Command Register
        To tell the device to perform a certain task
    Data Register
        To pass data to the device or get data from the device

    1. OS waits until device is ready to receive a command (polling the device)
    2. OS sends data to the data register
        If main CPU is involved with the data movement, we refer to it as programmed I/O (PIO)
    3. OS writes command to the command register
        Lets the device know that data is present and should work on the command
    4. OS waits until device is finished (polling)

    Problems
        Inefficient - waste CPU just to wait instead of switching to another ready process

36.4 Lowering CPU Overhead With Interrupts
    Instead of continually polling the device, OS can issue a request, put the process to sleep and context switch
    Hardware interrupt when device is finished with its operation

    Livelock
        Only processing interrupts and never allowing a user-level process to run

    Coalescing
        Multiple interrupts can be coalesced into a single interrupt delivery
            May increase latency of request

36.5 More Efficient Data Movement With DMA
    Direct Memory Access
        OS would program the engine by telling where it lives in the memory
        How much data to copy
        Which device to send data to
